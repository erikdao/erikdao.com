It is not about the latest machine learning models or algorithms, but about everything else from data engineering, feature engineering, techniques to create good training data, different ways to evaluate ML models, the importance of monitoring data distribution shifts, to a practical review of popular MLOps tooling.",

Initially, I dismissed it as just another self-help book, but I‚Äôm pleased to admit my mistake. \"Chatter\" offers a scientific and psychological insight into our inner voice, particularly the spirals of negative thought and their effects.",
            "This book struck a deep chord with me. Having battled depression since 2023, I often found myself spiraling into a chaotic mess of negative thoughts. Kross sheds light on these thoughts, explaining them as manifestations of our inner voice. He illustrates how they impact our emotions, yet also how they enable us to run mental simulations and evaluate progress toward our goals.",
            "Kross then introduces methods to manage our inner voice and its negative spirals. One technique I‚Äôve embraced is journaling. Writing down my thoughts, especially when addressing myself in the second person or by name, helps create distance from negative experiences. This process allows me to construct narratives and view my experiences from a narrator‚Äôs perspective. I can attest to its effectiveness in unburdening my mind and reducing the exhaustion caused by incessant thoughts. Since I started journaling last year, I‚Äôve noticed a decrease in the intensity and frequency of my worries.",
            "Ethan Kross concludes the book by providing a suite of tools for dealing with negative internal chatter. Some techniques are self-directed, while others involve our social circles. I highly recommend giving these methods a try; there is a good chance they work for you!"

Each of the claims the author is making is backed up by wealth of research, and synthesizes ideas from a variety of disciplines. For a skeptical reader, the range of original research sources referenced in the book should be a valuable resource in reviewing the claims made in the book."

Walker begins by debunking common misconceptions about sleep, such as the idea that we can get by on less than seven hours per night or that we can catch up on sleep on the weekends, stressing its crucial role in memory, emotion regulation, and cognitive function.He presents intriguing research showing how lack of sleep affects everything from our immune system to our cardiovascular health, and even our life expectancy.

Nguyen, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, presents a fragmentary reflection of the refugee experience, characterized by both lyrical and biting elements. The memoir is highly personal and political, recounting Nguyen's family's escape from Vietnam in 1975 and their life in San Jos√©, California, where his parents ran a Vietnamese grocery store. Nguyen's development as a writer, scholar, and citizen in what he refers to as AMERICA‚Ñ¢ is a central theme, highlighting the widening gap between him and his immigrant parents.",
            "The memoir is praised for its self-awareness and complex account of Nguyen's coming-of-age in a foreign land. It vividly portrays Nguyen's relationship with his parents, especially his mother, who suffered a mental break from which she never recovered. The narrative expresses Nguyen's desire to honor his mother, while also grappling with the fear of betraying her memory. Nguyen's critique of the model-refugee memoir is noted for its precision and humor, providing a blueprint for aspiring memoir writers that balances old-world hardship with subtle expressions of reconciliation."

          "This contemporary queer romance novel revolves around the enemies-to-lovers story of Alex Claremont-Diaz, the First Son of the United States, and Prince Henry of Walves as they navigate the complex world of politics, family traditions, their feelings for each other, and their queer identities. Alex is sharp, passionate, and eager to jumpstart his own political career. Henry (full name: Henry Goerge Edward James Fox-Moutchristen-Windsor) is much more private and guarded - a prince with a smile \"made to be printed on money.\" The two young men first appeared in the novel as hating each other, however, after Henry kissed Alex in a snowy garden on New Year's Eve, their love swiftly developed.",
          "McQuiston paints an alternative reality in the US political landscape in 2020: the first female President of the United States is running for reelection. That landscape is background to the development of the relationship between Alex and Henry. They were trying to keep their love in secret away from the public. Eventually, their relationship was leaked, and the two characters faced with the challenges to come to term with the fallout. The political backdrop adds depth to the narrative, making the characters' growth and self-discovery all the more impactful.",
          "Personally, I don't take this novel as a work of serious fiction, and I believe it isn't the intention of McQuiston for it to be that way. While the writing is engaging and filled with witty banter, it can be overly empathic. The rivalry between Alex and Henry at the beginning of the novel seems exaggerated, and the \"happy ending\" feels like it didn't require much effort, and somehow not so important. And although the sex is fun, it is cliche and lack of depth into real 'sex' as often depicted in gay novels. However, I still enjoy reading this book. In McQuiston's world, we can be fun and enjoy ourselves. We can have heartbreaks, crushes, and ridiculous confrontations in the rain. Sometimes the plot feels silly and calorie-free. But who cares! Equality means having access to every type of narrative, from the weighty to the frivolous."
