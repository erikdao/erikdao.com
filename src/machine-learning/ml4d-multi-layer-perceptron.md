Feedforward Neural Networks (FFN) are one the most popular types of deep learning models. Essentially, an FFN learn to approximate a function $$f$$ that maps input $$\mathbf{x}$$ to category (or class labels) $$\mathbf{y}$$. Even though, there have now been many other types of neural networks that are designed to deal with some specific type of data (e.g., CNN for images, RNN for sequential data), FFN still plays an important role in the architecture of modern neural networks.

Intuitively, an FFN is composed of several _layers_ of _neurons_. The figure below illustrates an FFN of 5 layers &ndash; one _input_ layer, three _hidden_ layers and one _output_ layer.
