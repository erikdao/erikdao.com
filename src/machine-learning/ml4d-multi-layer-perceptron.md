Neural networks have taken landscape of machine learning over the past decade, with tremendous success in applications including image classification, object detection, machine translation, etc. In this article, we're going to review a simple type of neural networks named **feed-forward neural network** (FFN), or formally known as **multi-layer perceptron** (MLP).
