Linear regression, a fundamental and popular tools used in data science, can be looked at through two different lenses: that of machine learning and statistics. In this blog post, we√§ll explore linear regression from both these engles, dissecting how it's ultilized in both worlds. Whether you're more inclined towards data-driven algorithms or traditional statistical methods, let's dive into it together through the key differences and similarities.

## Linear Regression as a Statistical method
In statistic, linear regression is a method to model the relationship between observed variables. Given an input vector $$\mathbf{X}^\top = \left( X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p \right)$$, and a real-value output $$Y$$, the model has the form
<div class="block-equation">
  $$Y = f\left(\mathbf{X}\right) = \displaystyle \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{p} X_j \beta_j$$
</div>
where $$\beta_j$$ are unknown parameters or <em>coefficients</em> for which we want to estimate from the data. The input $$X_j$$ can come from different sources:

* quantitative inputs
* transformations of quantitive inputs, e.g., log, square or square-root
* basic expansions, e.g., $$X_2 = X_1 ^2, X_3 = X_1^3$$
* interaction between variables, e.g., $$X_3 = X_1 . X_2 $$


In a typical setting, we want to estimate the coefficients from some training data $$\left(x_1, y_1\right), \dots, \left(x_N, y_N\right)$$. Each sample $$x_i = \left( x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \dots, x_{ip}\right)^\top$$ is a vector containing $$p$$ features. The most popular method for estimating $$\beta$$ is <em>least square</em>, in which we pick the coefficients $$\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p$$ to minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS)
<div class="block-equation">
  $$\text{RSS} \left( \beta \right) = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^N \left( y_i - f\left(x_i\right) \right)^2 \\ = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N \left( y_i -  \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij} \beta_j\right)^2$$
</div>
As we can see from the equation above, the <em>residual</em> is simply the difference between the predicted and actual output.

How do we minimize the RSS? Let's get hands-on with some maths. First denote $$\mathbf{X}$$ as matrix of dimension $$N \times (p + 1)$$ whose each row represents an input vector, and $$\mathbf{y}$$ is the output vector of size $$N$$.
<div class="block-equation">
  $$\text{RSS} \left( \beta \right) = \displaystyle \left(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \beta \right)^\top \left(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \beta \right)$$
</div>
This is a quadratic function; hence, to find the parameter $$\beta$$ that minimizes the function, we find the solution $$\beta$$ when setting the first derivative of the function to $$0$$. Differentiating RSS w.r.t to $$\beta$$, we have
<div class="block-equation">
  $$\displaystyle \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta} = -2 \mathbf{X}^\top \left(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \beta \right)$$
</div>
Setting the first derivative to $$0$$, and solve for $$\beta$$ we obtain
<div class="block-equation">
  $$\begin{aligned} \displaystyle \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta} = -2 \mathbf{X}^\top \left(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \beta \right) &= 0 \\ \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{y} -  \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta &= 0 \\ \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta &= \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{y} \\ \beta &= \left( \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \right)^{-1} \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{y} \end{aligned} \\ $$
</div>
The solution above is made with an assumption that matrix $$\mathbf{X}$$ has full column rank, i.e., there is no column in $$\mathbf{X}$$ that depends on any other column. (For those who want to entertain with the step-by-step explainations of the result, see the Supplementary section at the end of this post.)


Once we have estimated the coefficients $$\beta$$, given a new input vector $$x_0$$, the output is computed as $$f\left( x_0 \right) = \left( 1: x_0 \right) \beta$$. Note that we prepend a column containing $$1$$ to $$x_0$$.

For curious readers, there are mulitiple methods to estimate parameters $$\beta$$. However, the [Gauss-Markov theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Markov_theorem) states that least squares estimates of the paramters $$\beta$$ have lowest variance amongst all linear unbiased estimates. Therefore, least square estimation is a common statistical method for estimating the parameters of the linear regression model. For this method to work, there are several assumptions made:

1. **Linearity**
2. **Full rank**
3. **Zero Conditional Mean of Error**
4. **Homoscedascity**
5. **Non-autocorrelation**
6. **Normality**

### Derivative of RSS w.r.t. to $$\beta$$

* Start by expanding the equation for RSS, and utilizing a simple rule when multiplying the transpose of matrices $$(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B})^\top = \mathbf{B}^\top \mathbf{A}^\top$$
<div class="block-equation">
  $$\begin{aligned} \text{RSS} \left( \beta \right) &= \displaystyle \left(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \beta \right)^\top \left(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{X} \beta \right) \\ &= \mathbf{y}^\top \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{y}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta - \beta^\top \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{y} + \beta^\top \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta \end{aligned}$$
</div>

* Compute the partial derivative of RSS w.r.t to $$\beta$$. Note that the partial derivative w.r.t $$\beta$$ of a term that doesn't contain $$\beta$$ is $$0$$.
<div class="block-equation">
$$\begin{aligned} \frac{\partial \text{RSS}}{\partial \beta} &= \frac{\partial \left( \mathbf{y}^\top \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{y}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta - \beta^\top \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{y} + \beta^\top \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta \right)}{\partial \beta} \\ &= - \mathbf{y}^\top \mathbf{X} - \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{y} + 2 \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta \\ &= -2 \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{y} + 2 \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta \end{aligned}$$
</div>

The partial derivative $$\frac{\partial \beta^\top \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta}{\partial \beta} = 2 \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta$$ as the matrix $$\mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X}$$ is a symmetric matrix (See [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_calculus#Scalar-by-vector_identities) and [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose#Products))

* Set the first derivative to $$0$$
<div class="block-equation">
$$\begin{aligned} -2 \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{y} + 2 \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta &= 0 \\ \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{X} \beta &= \mathbf{X}^\top \mathbf{y} \end{aligned}$$
</div>
