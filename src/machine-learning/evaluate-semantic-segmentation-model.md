excerpt: "Semantic segmentation is a dense-prediction task. When evaluating segmentation models, common evaluation metrics such as classification accuracy is not useful. In this post, I'm going to show you two metrics for evaluating image segmentation models."

Semantic segmentation is a dense-prediction task where the model predicts class-label for every pixel in the input image. However, we can't use classification accuracy to measure how well a segmentation model performs. In this post, I'll discuss several methods for evaluating semantic image segmentation models.

## Semantic segmentation

## Intersection over Union (IoU)
The Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, also referred as the Jaccard index

## Dice
