In my <a href="/machine-learning/introduction-to-autoencoders" class="link">previous post</a>, I covered the theory behind autoencoder, an unsupervised neural network for compression and feature learning. One of the interesting types of autoencoders is denoising autoencoders (DAE) that learns to reconstruct the original data from the noisy/corrupted input. In this post, let's get hands-on with actually building a DAE in Pytorch. We'll also be using Pytorch Lightning to make the process building a full ML pipeline (i.e., reading/processing data, building model, training, monitoring, etc.) much more enjoyable.

## Define the model

## Load the data

## Define training loop
