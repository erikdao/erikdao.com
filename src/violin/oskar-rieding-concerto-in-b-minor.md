The Violin Concerto in B Minor, Op. 35, is one of the most popular works by Oskar Rieding. [Rieding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Rieding) was a German violinist, composer and teacher of music. The concerto is written entirely in the first position, ranging from the open G to the B on the E string. Even with this limited range of musical territory, Rieding created an expressive piece of music. The concerto has three movements:
* **I. Allegro moderato** in B Minor
* **II. Andante** in G Major, with the middle section leaning towards G Minor
* **III. Allegro moderato** in B Minor

This concerto is often practiced by beginners and students in the early stages of violin learning. To me, it is such a lovely, challenging piece that gives a sense of accomplishment on my violin journey.

## Notable performances

Even though it's considered a piece for students, there are several recordings from professional violinists. Most notably,  [Itzhak Perlman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itzhak_Perlman), one our the most celebrated violinists in our time, played this concerto with the Julliard Orchestra in his CD _Concertos from My Childhood_. This performace is, as expected, supreme. You can listen to his recording on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhvIiXonxzI), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0hGBTqulk3OZ4Yle4Cnteq), or [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/se/album/concertos-from-my-childhood/1025538364?l=en-GB)

Another great recording is from [Mikhail Gantvarg](https://eng.spdm.ru/mikhail-gantvarg), a Russian professor and violinist. The recording is available on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/se/album/50-classic-violin-concertos-bach-mozart-vivaldi-more/471502152?l=en-GB)

## My practice

I started learning this concerto on Nov 5th, 2024. I'm breaking down how I've practiced all the movements of the concerto below

### 1st movement
The sheet music I've been using is similar to [this one](https://musescore.com/user/26947216/scores/9770629) on Musescore. Since this movement is in B Minor, it helps a lot to start each practice session by practicing the melodic minor scale in B. Whenever I practice a scale, I always try to use the whole bow, starting with one note per bow and then gradually increasing to two or four notes per bow. As a beginner, I focus on listening carefully to the notes as I practice, so I can develop a better sense of intonation when playing the movement.

### 2nd movement

### 3rd movement

As Jan 2nd, 2025, I'm still learning this movement.
