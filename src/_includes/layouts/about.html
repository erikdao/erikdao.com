      <p>I start this blog with two purposes 1) to document my journey while learning new things, and 2) to share them with others and my future self. The former reason is to make sure that I understand what I've learned, and also to eliminate my scare of writing ;-) And the latter is to satisfy my wish to contribute to the community. I like to learn new things, and as I'm learning, this blog is always a work-in-progress. That's said, there might be something you disagree with or want to give your comments about on this blog, and you're more than welcome to do so. Let's talk!</p>

      <p>I'm actively looking for jobs in machine learning, data science in either academia or industry.

      </h2>
      <p>I'm living in Stockholm, Sweden and doing a master in machine learning at <a class="link" href="https://kth.se" target="_blank">KTH</a>. I'm originally from Vietnam where I completed a bachelor in computer science at <a class="link" href="https://soict.hust.edu.vn" target="_blank">HUST</a>. In 2015, I first played with neural networks during my summer internship at <a class="link" href="https://www.nus.edu.sg" target="_blank">NUS</a> in Singapore. I built a ship image classifier in Caffe and published my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=vi&user=CiXsJrcAAAAJ&citation_for_view=CiXsJrcAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C" class="link" target="_blank">first paper</a> during the same year. After my bachelor in 2017, I spent six months at <a class="link" href="https://kaust.edu.sa" target="_blank">KAUST</a> in Saudi Arabia building fish detectors (with Faster-RCNN) and devising bits and pieces of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=CiXsJrcAAAAJ&citation_for_view=CiXsJrcAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC" target="_blank" class="link">a deep architecture</a> for weakly-supervised human action localization.
      </p>
      <p>Those two internships were formative. They revealed to me the fascinating achievements of machine learning (especially deep learning) both in academia and industry. I was motivated to learn more about the field. So I attempted to apply for PhD programs in the United States in three consecutive years, 2016, 2017, 2018 but didn't really get to where I wanted. I got discouraged a bit by those failures, and was occasionally self-doubt if I could get anywhere in machine learning with my modest background.</p>
      <p>I took a break from ML and joined a startup in Silicon Valley called <a href="https://insightfellows.com" target="_blank" class="link">Insight</a>. At Insight, I formed and led a team of five engineers building a social platform for 4000+ data professionals - the company's alumni. My works span across backend, frontend, deployment and automation. My primary toolset at Insight includes Python, Django, Typescript, React, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, AWS. Occasionally, I explore some other techs such as Python Tornado, React Native or Cucumber to create mission-critical pieces of the systems we build in the company. Lately, I've been responsible for the analytics pipeline to discover insights and help the company's fellows to find new jobs.</p>
      <p>In 2020, I was determined to get a proper education in ML; thus, I flew through the COVID-19 pandemic to Sweden to start my master program. During this summer (2021), I've been interning at <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439" target="_blank" class="link">RPL</a>, KTH. My work involves training vision transformers in a self-supervised manner to learn meaningful visual representations from images for weakly supervised object detection and semantic segmentation.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>In May 2018, I welcomed Louis - a British shorthair - to my home. We lived together for three years in various places. Sadly, I couldn't bring him with me when I moved to Sweden. He's forstered by a friend and has been enjoying his new home with another cat named Tei Tei. As of September 2021, Louis is the father of 5 cute kittens.</p>
