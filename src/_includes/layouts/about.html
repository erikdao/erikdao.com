      <p>I start this blog with two purposes 1) to document my journey while learning new things; and 2) to share them with others and my future self. The former reason is to make sure that I understand what I've learned, and also to eliminate my scare of writing ;-) The later is to satisfy my personal wish to contribute to the community. This blog is always a work-in-progress as I'm learning and like to learn new things. That's said there might be something you disagree or want to give your comments about on this blog, and you're more than welcome to do so. Let's talk!</p>

      </h2>
      <p>I'm living in Stockholm, Sweden and doing a master in machine learning at <a class="link" href="https://kth.se" target="_blank">KTH</a>. I'm originally from Vietnam where I completed a bachelor in computer science at <a class="link" href="https://soict.hust.edu.vn" target="_blank">HUST</a>. In 2015, I first played with neural networks during my summer internship at National University of Singapore (<a class="link" href="https://www.nus.edu.sg" target="_blank">NUS</a>). I built a ship image classifier in Caffe and published my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=vi&user=CiXsJrcAAAAJ&citation_for_view=CiXsJrcAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C" class="link" target="_blank">first paper</a> during the same year. After my bachelor in 2017, I spent 6 months at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (<a class="link" href="https://kaust.edu.sa" target="_blank">KAUST</a>) in Saudi Arabia building fish detector (with Faster-RCNN) and doing weakly-supervised human action localization.</p>

      <p>In May 2018, I welcomed Louis - a British shorthair - to my home. We lived together for three years in various places. Sadly, I couldn't bring him with me when I moved to Sweden. He's forstered by a friend and has been enjoying his new home with another cat named Tei Tei. As of September 2021, Louis is the father of 5 cute kittens.</p>
