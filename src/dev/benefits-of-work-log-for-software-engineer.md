As a software engineer, your day-to-day job might include lots of context-switching. In one moment, you're focusing on triaging a bug, and in the next, you're explaining your team's roadmap to a non-tech colleague. It's easy to lose track of what you've done, what you're currently working on, and what you need to do next. This is where a work log comes in handy.Â In this post, I'll share my personal experience with work logs and how they've helped me grow as a software engineer.
